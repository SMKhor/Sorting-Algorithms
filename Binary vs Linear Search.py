"""
Binary Vs Linear Search

Code to generate a list of numbers then perform a binary and a linear search.
You will be able to see the performance difference.

Look carefully, the Linear search is performing very well right now, so
why does everyone recommend a Binary Search?

How could you make this a fairer comparison?
